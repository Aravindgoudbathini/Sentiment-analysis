Situation: I needed a practical text dataset from a real-world source to apply and demonstrate text processing and analysis skills. Public commentary on topical subjects like "MCU ethics" provided a suitable domain.

Task: My objective was to gather relevant data, specifically tweets or tweet-like content related to MCU ethics, and then perform a comprehensive analysis to understand the characteristics of the discussion, including engagement levels, sentiment, and key conversational themes.

Action: I began the data acquisition process by utilizing Python, leveraging the Beautiful Soup library to extract the necessary textual data from a relevant web source displaying this type of content. Once obtained, I loaded the data into R, preparing it for analysis by unnesting tokens and removing common stop words. I calculated basic metrics like the count of English tweets, the retweet ratio, and the frequency of hyperlinks to characterize the dataset. I conducted sentiment analysis using the Bing lexicon, identifying and visualizing the most frequent positive and negative terms. To understand conceptual relationships, I also constructed a network graph of frequently occurring words.

Result: Through these steps, I successfully sourced, processed, and analyzed the dataset. This provided valuable insights into the nature of the conversation around MCU ethics, revealing engagement patterns, the overall sentiment expressed, and the interconnectedness of key discussion points. This project effectively showcased my abilities in data extraction using tools like Beautiful Soup and performing detailed text analysis in R.
